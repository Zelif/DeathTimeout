DeathTimeout

After a player dies they are kicked from the server.
They cannot join the server untill the ban has gone
for the selected amount of time.(Configurable it is in seconds)

Thanks to the maker of Tempban InfiniteMinecraft without your plugin
I could not have got my head around using hashmaps ;D
